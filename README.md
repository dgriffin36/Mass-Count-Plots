# Overview
Data and JMP (Statistical Discovery ^{TM} Software for SAS) graphing script posted in association with the manuscript titled "Mass-Count Plots for Crystal Size Control" by D. J. Griffin, M. A. Grover, Y. Kawajiri, and R. W. Rousseau [1]. 

## Creating Mass-Count Plots using JMP
Mass-count plots, like those published in [1], can be created with JMP software. The attached script (MCplot.jsl) will automatically create a mass-count plot for crystallization data organized as follows:
time [min] | chord counts | crystal mass [g] | molar supersaturation | temperature [C]

An example data set is provided: LinearCoolingCrystallization.jmp
