J. Griffin, M. A. Grover, Y. Kawajiri, and R. W. Rousseau [1]. \r\n\r\n## Creating Mass-Count Plots using JMP\r\nMass-count plots, like those published in [1], can be created with JMP software. The attached script (MCplot.jsl) will automatically create a mass-count plot for crystallization data organized as follows:\r\ntime [min] | chord counts | crystal mass [g] | molar supersaturation | temperature [C]\r\n\r\nAn example data set is provided: LinearCoolingCrystallization.jmp\r\n\r\n### JMP License\r\nhttp://www.jmp.com/en_us/software/buy-jmp.html\r\n\r\n###Bibliography\r\n[1] Griffin, D.
